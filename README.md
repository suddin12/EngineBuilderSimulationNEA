This will be a simulation built using WinForms in C#, which will allow the user to create their own engine, whilst having different sounds for different configurations of engines. Additionally, the user can change the number of pistons, bore size, and the length of the stroke, and they can also change the RPMs, allowing power to be high or low, depending on the application e.g. for a sports car or a basic car. The user will be able to save engine configurations that they like in a file, which can be restored on start-up if requested
